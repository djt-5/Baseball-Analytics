# Variable Importance in Secondary Pitch Design
My main goal was to figure out the rank of importance in pitch variables in determining swings & misses, and chases, to help pitchers better their arsenals. I took secondary pitches thrown after fastballs, calculated multiple tunnel effects, and ran the data through **Extreme Gradient Boosting (xgboost)** to measure the importance of each variable.
