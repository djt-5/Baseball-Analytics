# Pitch Tunneling ShinyApp
Tunneling an offspeed pitch with a fastball is an important factor in generating swings and misses. This app aims to visualize the factors that contributed to MLB pitchers' success with whiffs, chases, and groundballs in 2023 using
* A strike zone visualizing where the pitches were thrown
* Pitch metrics graphs visualizing release points, break, tunnel points, post tunnel break, velocity, spin, etc.
* A heatmap showing how effective a pitcher is in whiffs, chases, and groundballs based on the fastball/secondary pitch combination
* Regression plots showing the best quantities of a certain variable to aim for when improving performance
* Regression plots putting two predictor variables up against each other to check for collinearity
* A summary table of each pitch type, its metrics, and its results
* A data table of each individual pitch thrown with filtering capabilities of the predictor variables, showing which metrics are best for optimizing performance (release angle, release direction, spin rate, spin axis, velocity, etc)
* Filtering capability for game date to contrast a struggling stretch from an optimal one
