# University of Illinois Baseball Shiny App
This is a web development app I wrote used by the UIUC Baseball analysts to aid in pitcher development. It has seven major components:
* Strike Zone heat maps to show where the pitcher should throw
* Spray chart to see where the pitcher is getting hit
* Pitch variables such as release point, spin, speed, and break
* Pitch sequencing suggestions
* Graphs that measure pitcher performance over the course of the game 
* A table summarizing the effects of each pitch type for that pitcher
* A space to run linear and logistic models to measure covariates and performance

The app has functionality to filter by pitch type, velocity, break, spin rate, exit velocity, and launch angle.
