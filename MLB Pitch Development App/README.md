# Pitch Development ShinyApp

This is a tool I developed to dig through a pitcher's secondary pitches, thrown after a fastball, and see which targets are best to hit to maximize the probability of a whiff, chase or ground ball. The app offers summaries of each pitch, many filtering capabilities, and common sense data visualization. For any questions reach me at danielthom18@outlook.com.
