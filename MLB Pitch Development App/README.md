# Pitch Development ShinyApp

This is a tool I developed to dig through an MLB pitcher's secondary pitches, thrown after a fastball, and see which targets were best to hit to maximize the probability of a whiff, chase or ground ball in 2023. The app offers summaries of each pitch, measures of tunneling effects of the pitches (See [The Importance of Pitch Tunneling](https://github.com/djt-5/Baseball-Analytics/blob/main/The%20Importance%20of%20Tunneling%20Pitches/Pitch-Tunnel.pdf)), many filtering capabilities, and common sense data visualization. For any questions reach me at danielthom18@outlook.com.
