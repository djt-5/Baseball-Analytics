# The Importance of Tunneling Pitches
The idea of tunneling pitches is that two different pitches fly down the same trajectory long enough to look nearly identical through the point when a hitter must decide whether, or not, to swing. If pitches thrown back to back travel down this same 'tunnel' long enough, a hitter won’t be able to tell them apart until it’s too late. 

My main goal was to figure out how important this effect is in determining swings & misses, chases, and groundballs to help pitchers better their arsenals. I took secondary pitches thrown after fastballs, calculated multiple tunnel effects, and ran the data through **Gradient Boosting ML algorithms** to measure the importance of each variable.

Spoiler Alert: Pitch Tunneling matters when it comes to getting swings and misses.
