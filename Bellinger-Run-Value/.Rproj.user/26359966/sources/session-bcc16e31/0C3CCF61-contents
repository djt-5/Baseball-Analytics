For example, after 1st and 2nd with 1 out, a team scores on average 0.908 runs. If Bellinger strikes out, the situation then calls for 0.343 runs. Bellinger's Run Value on the last pitch of the strikeout would be -0.565. This statistic tells you everything you need to know about how a batter affects the run scoring of the game, which is basically what every hitting statistic is trying to paint a picture of. Enjoy!"),
