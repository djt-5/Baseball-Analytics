# Spring Training Shiny App

This is an app I developed for the [Athlete Lab Sports Coding & Data Integration Course](https://www.athletelab.io) that looks over Spring Training data and analyzes the performances of roster players and prospects. 

This specific app is for the Pittsburgh Pirates, and was made for [My Analysis Here](https://medium.com/@danielthom18/analyzing-the-pittsburgh-pirates-top-prospects-in-spring-training-part-1-pitchers-f39a67473a09) But there is data included for all the teams in this repo for you to experiment with.
