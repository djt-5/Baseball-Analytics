This repository includes projects I have worked on for both the Illini Baseball team as well as curious MLB statitical work, including

**UIUC Baseball Shiny Apps**
* Is used by the UIUC baseball team to write scouting reports
* Includes both a Pitcher and Batter version
* Works with pitch-by-pitch data to visualize patterns in the strike zone, on the field, and changes in those patterns as the game goes on, with live adjusting for pitch type, break, velocity, spin, etc.
* (Pitcher App) Measures pitch tunneling by displaying release points, angles, similarity in early movement, and differences in late movement of the pitch based on pitch type
* Visualizes for pitchers the best pitch to throw for a certain outcome (if you want a whiff, a chase, a groundball...) based on the count & the previous pitch thrown. For hitters, this is displayed as a pitch guessing tool.
* Employs both regular and generalized linear regression models to help the user know which variables are relevant in determining certain patterns
