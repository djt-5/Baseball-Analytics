# Welcome
This repository includes projects I have worked on for both the Illini Baseball team and MLB statitical work.

**UIUC Baseball Shiny Apps**
* Is used by the UIUC baseball team to write scouting reports
* Includes both a Pitcher & Batter version
* Works with Trackman data to visualize patterns in the strike zone, on the field, & changes in those patterns as the game goes on, with live adjusting for pitch type, break, velocity, spin, etc.
* (Pitcher App) Measures pitch tunneling by displaying release points, angles, similarity in early movement, & differences in late movement of the pitch based on pitch type
* Visualizes for pitchers the best pitch to throw for a certain outcome (if you want a whiff, a chase, a groundball...) based on the count & the previous pitch thrown. For hitters, this is displayed as a pitch guessing tool.
* Employs both regular & generalized linear regression models to help the user know which variables are relevant in determining certain patterns

**Run Expectancy of Tagging**
* Calculates the run expectancy of tagging decisions on the bases. This project concludes that baseball teams hurt their offenses by not tagging up enough. This project employs linear modeling and statistical theory.
