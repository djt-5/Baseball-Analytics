# Why Baserunners Need to Tag Up More
Have you ever watched your favorite team hit a deep fly ball that was caught, feeling alright because at least the baserunner on first or second can get to move up, only to see he never tagged? 

This frustrated me to a great extent and motivated me to research if deciding to tag up would have been the right move. This project looks at flyballs in play when a runner was on first and/or second with less than two outs. Using simple logistic modeling, it estimates the probability a runner would be safe or out based on the throwing distance from the base they would tag to. A hypothetical delta run expectancy is calculated by weighing the outcomes with the probabilities, and the other possibility of the ball landing for a hit. This hypothetical delta run expectancy is compared to the actual delta run expectancy of the play. 

As it turns out, every team in 2023 would have scored more runs if they tagged on 100% of reasonably deep fly balls.
